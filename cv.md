### ABOUT ME:


Good day! 

My name is Aliaksandr. 

In RS for the first time, I haven’t heard about you before, but I am glad that it was fate to get to your project.
I can’t serve myself badly, but know I’m cool and sociable!

### SKILLS:

* I play basketball
* I find people approaching
* I love to sleep and quickly fall asleep
* I don't give up on life

### CODE EXAMPLES:

A little bit later

### EXPERIENCE:

Well what can I say. So it turned out that now only matured. I went to a variety of courses, but rather purely for myself. And now I am in the mood for change of life.

### EDUCATION:

Behind shoulders college, university and a bunch of courses :)

Thanks for your attention!
